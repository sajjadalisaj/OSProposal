# OSProposal

<p>In this project we are going to work on different process schedule algorithms for example SJF, FCFS etc. This project is based on Python language in which user will initiate the each and every process including algorithm type, number of processes with burst time and arrival time. The program will calculate Turn Around Time, Waiting Time, Completion Time, Average Turn Around Time and Average Waiting Time. With the help of Process Table and Graphs user will be able to understand which process is taking less time for completion.  </P>
